# Add HTTP Method to Resource-timing entry

Proposal to add a new field `httpMethod` to PerformanceResourceTiming which is an [ByteString](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-ByteString) highlighting the method used to fetch a resource.

## Usecases

The addition of this field will allow for the following scenarios (per [w3c/resource-timing#373](https://github.com/w3c/resource-timing/issues/373)):

- Being able to debug and tease out specific cases where a POST request causes more overhead than a GET request and vice-versa.
- Being able to segregate the performance of URLs based of the HTTP methods used to access them (for example when monitoring a REST API)

## API Changes

The PerformanceResourceTiming interface in the [w3c/resource-timing](https://github.com/w3c/resource-timing) specification would need to be updated:

```diff
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface PerformanceResourceTiming : PerformanceEntry {
    readonly attribute DOMString initiatorType;
    readonly attribute DOMString deliveryType;
    readonly attribute ByteString nextHopProtocol;
+   readonly attribute ByteString httpMethod
    readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp workerStart;
    ...
    readonly attribute unsigned short responseStatus;
    readonly attribute RenderBlockingStatusType renderBlockingStatus;
    [Default] object toJSON();
};
```

## Example code

An example of how the `httpMethod` field can be used is shown below, in this case the code is logging all resources that were fetched using the `POST` method.

```js
const entries = performance.getEntries();
for( entry in entries ) {
    if ( entry.httpMethod === 'POST' ) {
        console.log( entry );
    }
}
```

## Specification changes

The following changes to specifications will be required to implement this feature:

- Fetch
  - New `httpMethod` field added to [fetch_timing_info](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-timing-info)
  - The [Fetching algorithm](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetching) is modified to initialize [fetch_timing_info](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-timing-info)'s `httpMethod` field with the [request's method](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-method)

- ResourceTiming
  - Add `httpMethod` field to [PerformanceResourceTiming interface](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#sec-performanceresourcetiming)
  - A PerformanceResourceTiming has an associated ByteString http method.
  - The httpMethod getter steps are to return this's [normalized](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-method-normalize) http method.

## Security/Privacy Considerations

The field should not reveal any new cross-origin information. The ResourceTiming API only reports data about entries in the current frame, thus no cross-origin information is revealed.

Additionally, the data made available via this field can already be obtained by a page by proxying/wrapping the fetch API globally.
